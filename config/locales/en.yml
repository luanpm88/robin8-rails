      text: "<p>Miranda Tan, Founder and CEO of Robin8, founded her first PR firm,
        ExcitePR, in 1999. She realized that businesses offering amazing products
        were constantly running into the same problem: how could they reach out to
        the right influencers and achieve maximum effectiveness for their message.</p>
        \     <p>Miranda’s answer was an intuitive, easy to use, do-it-yourself PR
        software platform she founded in 2007 with her partner, digital media pro
        Hassan Miah. By 2010, the PR solution had been named a Top 100 OnDemand Software
        Company, a Top 100 Mid-Atlantic Private Company, and a Top 100 OnMedia company
        by AlwaysOn.</p>      <p>In 2014, with the emergence of big data and machine
        learning as pillars of the latest technological advancements, Miranda and
        Hassan, in partnership with some of the world’s brightest thought leaders,
        rebuilt the platform to take advantage of next generation Artificial Intelligence.
        After months of hard work and collaboration, Robin8 was created.</p>      <p>What
        if you knew EXACTLY who to contact for every campaign, based on a data-driven
        prediction on how successful each pitch will be? Robin8 can do all this and
        more.</p>      <p>Robin8 uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
        big data to take the guesswork out of social and content marketing.  With
        its proprietary predictive intelligence engine, Robin8 helps you maximize
        your reach by intelligently analyzing and understanding which journalists
        and influencers will be the best fit for your campaign.</p>      <p>Robin8
        is personalized to each user's digital profile.  Each time you use Robin8,
        it learns your preferences, gets smarter and generates the best results for
        your campaign.</p>"

      security:
        measures: Our Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss,
          misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Robin8 safeguards
          the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and other

          browser software sends it to us. The SSL software decodes the data only
          after it reaches Robin8's server, meaning that your data will be encrypted
          were hackers to intercept it while in transit. Once the data reaches our
          server, your private account and customer information is located on a secure
          service behind a firewall. It is not directly connected to the Internet.
        title: SECURITY
      terms_definition: Robin8 ("Robin8," "we," "us" or "our") respects the privacy
        of visitors to our website. This privacy policy (the "Policy") covers the
        site at www.robin8.com ("Site"). The purpose of this Policy is to inform our
        users ("you") about the types of information we gather about you when you
        visit our Site, how we may use that information, what choices you have regarding
        our use of your information and how you may access some of the information
        you provide to us. Robin8 reserves the right to change this Policy at any
        time by posting a new privacy policy at this location. Therefore, you are
        responsible for periodically checking the Policy for changes.
      terms_of_use:
        cease_use: The Site is maintained for your convenient access to information
          about our company, products and services, as well as links, news and other
          items of interest in the PR industry. In addition, in certain instances,
          users with account information can order products online. IF AT ANY TIME
          THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU SHOULD
          IMMEDIATELY CEASE ALL USE OF THE SITE.

          general_rule: As a general rule, as set out in our Site's Privacy Policy,
            no personally identifiable information is automatically collected from
            users of our Site. If Robin8 does decide to change its policies, it will
            post such changes in accordance with this Agreement and/or its Privacy
            Policy. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you voluntarily disclose
            personal information online - for example, on your personal profile, message
            boards, through e-mail, or in blogs - that information can be collected
            and used by others, as set forth in the privacy policy. In short, if you
            post personal information online that is accessible to other members,
            we cannot control the other members' use of that information.
          materials: Statements, messages, text, files, images, photos, videos, or
            other materials ("Materials") posted by visitors to the Site, whether
            on profiles, message boards, blogs or in other formats, are the sole responsibility
            of the visitor who posted such Materials and reflect the opinions of the
            visitor who has posted them and not of Robin8. Although we discourage
            the use of any Site functionality, including profiles, message boards
            and blogs, for anything other than lawful and constructive discourse,
            we cannot effectively monitor all Materials posted by visitors on our
            Site and, therefore, make no representation and warranty with respect
            to the veracity, reliability or completeness of any such Materials. Accordingly,
            your reliance on any such Materials shall be at your own risk
          no_responsibility: Without limiting anything set out above, Robin8 assumes
            no responsibility for monitoring the Site for inappropriate Materials
            or conduct. If, at any time, we choose, in our sole discretion, to monitor
            the Site, we nonetheless assume no responsibility for the Materials, no
            obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Materials and no responsibility
            for the conduct of the visitor submitting any such Materials; however,
            Robin8 does reserve the right to remove any Materials that it determines,
            in its sole discretion, violates this Agreement or is otherwise unacceptable
            or inappropriate. The visitor shall remain responsible for any and all
            Materials he or she posts.
          prohibition: 'Robin8 specifically prohibits, and by your use of the Site,
            you expressly agree not to engage in, the following conduct: the deletion
            or alteration of any Materials posted on our Site by Robin8 or a third
            party; the taking of any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately
            large load on our Site infrastructure; using the Site directory information
            to post or transmit any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials,
            junk mail, spam, chain letters, telephone calls or other solicitations;
            and printing or otherwise copying or using any personally identifiable
            information about Site visitors or members for purposes other than contacting
            such visitors or members for industry-related inquiries.'
          sole_responsibility: Each visitor to the Site is solely responsible for
            his or her interactions with other visitors. Robin8 reserves the right,
            but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between visitors.
