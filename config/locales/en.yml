      text: "<p>Miranda Tan, Founder and CEO of Robin8, founded her first PR firm,
        ExcitePR, in 1999. She realized that businesses offering amazing products
        were constantly running into the same problem: how could they reach out to
        the right influencers and achieve maximum effectiveness for their message.</p>
        \     <p>Miranda’s answer was an intuitive, easy to use, do-it-yourself PR
        software platform she founded in 2007 with her partner, digital media pro
        Hassan Miah. By 2010, the PR solution had been named a Top 100 OnDemand Software
        Company, a Top 100 Mid-Atlantic Private Company, and a Top 100 OnMedia company
        by AlwaysOn.</p>      <p>In 2014, with the emergence of big data and machine
        learning as pillars of the latest technological advancements, Miranda and
        Hassan, in partnership with some of the world’s brightest thought leaders,
        rebuilt the platform to take advantage of next generation Artificial Intelligence.
        After months of hard work and collaboration, Robin8 was created.</p>      <p>What
        if you knew EXACTLY who to contact for every campaign, based on a data-driven
        prediction on how successful each pitch will be? Robin8 can do all this and
        more.</p>      <p>Robin8 uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
        big data to take the guesswork out of social and content marketing.  With
        its proprietary predictive intelligence engine, Robin8 helps you maximize
        your reach by intelligently analyzing and understanding which journalists
        and influencers will be the best fit for your campaign.</p>      <p>Robin8
        is personalized to each user's digital profile.  Each time you use Robin8,
        it learns your preferences, gets smarter and generates the best results for
        your campaign.</p>"

          were hackers to intercept it while in transit. Once the data reaches our
          server, your private account and customer information is located on a secure
          service behind a firewall. It is not directly connected to the Internet.

            Policy. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you voluntarily disclose
            personal information online - for example, on your personal profile, message
            boards, through e-mail, or in blogs - that information can be collected
            and used by others, as set forth in the privacy policy. In short, if you

            the use of any Site functionality, including profiles, message boards
            and blogs, for anything other than lawful and constructive discourse,
            we cannot effectively monitor all Materials posted by visitors on our

            or conduct. If, at any time, we choose, in our sole discretion, to monitor
            the Site, we nonetheless assume no responsibility for the Materials, no
            obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Materials and no responsibility
            for the conduct of the visitor submitting any such Materials; however,
            Robin8 does reserve the right to remove any Materials that it determines,
            in its sole discretion, violates this Agreement or is otherwise unacceptable
            or inappropriate. The visitor shall remain responsible for any and all
            Materials he or she posts.
          prohibition: 'Robin8 specifically prohibits, and by your use of the Site,
            you expressly agree not to engage in, the following conduct: the deletion
            or alteration of any Materials posted on our Site by Robin8 or a third
            party; the taking of any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately
            large load on our Site infrastructure; using the Site directory information

            junk mail, spam, chain letters, telephone calls or other solicitations;
            and printing or otherwise copying or using any personally identifiable
            information about Site visitors or members for purposes other than contacting
            such visitors or members for industry-related inquiries.'
