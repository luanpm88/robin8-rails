# Use this file to easily define all of your cron jobs.

# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
# set :output, "/path/to/my/cron_log.log"
#
# every '*/1 * * * *' do
#   runner "Subscription.process_initial_invoice"
# end

env :PATH, ENV['PATH']

set :output, {
  :error => File.join(path, "log", "cron_error.log"),
  :standard => File.join(path, "log", "cron.log")
