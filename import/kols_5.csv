facebook,60,Ms.,Kimberly,Vetrano,Blogger,She Scribes,https://www.facebook.com/SheScribes,https://www.linkedin.com/in/SheScribes,,,https://www.pinterest.com/shescribes,https://twitter.com/she_scribes,,kimberly@shescribes.com,http://www.shescribes.com,"Vetrano is a Blogger for She Scribes covering Entertainment, Family & Parenting, Pets & Pet Products, Technology, Toys, Beauty & Grooming, Personal Health & Wellness, Home, Lifestyle, Food & Beverages, Fashion, Jewelry, Games, and oversees New Product Reviews and the Holiday Gift Guides. The deadline for the Christmas gift guide is the end of November. The deadline for the other gift guides (Mather's Day, Father's Day, Back to School, etc.) is no less than three weeks before the holiday. 

Vetrano is flexible with pitches she accepts, acknowledging that it depends on the product or pitch. However, the best way to catch her attention it to gear the pitch toward her site, and/or her reader demographics.

""A pitch about a new vacuum is going to catch my attention more so than a pitch about a diaper bag or car seat since I don’t have infants and I don’t write about baby/toddler things,"" she says. 

""Take the time to check out my site, see what I write about and learn more about me so that you can pitch me with something that is clearly geared towards me and my blog. Also, please personalize the pitch. Don’t address it 'Dear Blogger' or even worse, 'Insert Name Here' (I have had MANY pitches like that).""

She continues, ""Someone with a cheery, upbeat attitude is going to impress me more than someone who sends me a form letter. I also like when PR reads a post or two on my site and mentions that in the pitch – for example ‘I think it’s cool that you have five cats and a dog. You must really love animals?.’ That tells me that the PR rep took the time to read my blog and sent me a pitch geared towards me and my blog and not just a blanket pitch.""

Vetrano advises PR professionals to learn about her before sending a pitch, and to be considerate of her personal life.

""If you take the time to read the ‘About Me’ section on a blog you will know it’s a waste of time to pitch baby products or garden products to me. Also, understand that blogging for most people takes a backseat to family life. You have to be a bit flexible and understanding. If you need a post up by a specific date you need to make that known at the very beginning so the blogger can plan accordingly. Also, please reply to e-mails in a prompt manner, especially when it has to do with a post. It’s hard to complete a post on time when the blogger has questions or needs more information and the PR person doesn't get back to them in a timely manner.""

On pet peeves, Vetrano comments, ""PR wanting me to post about a new product (without a review), a contest on a company’s website or a new campaign a company is working on. My time and my readers’ time is valuable. I am not going to post about every pitch that is sent to me unless it’s worth my time and effort, or unless it’s compensated in some way. I will post things for free but not all the time. I also do not write reviews based on photos! That is a huge pet peeve of mine. How am I expected to give a fair and honest review for my readers based on a products PHOTO?""

""Also, I can’t stand it when I am working on something and the PR rep leaves their job and doesn't let the blogger know who the new contact will be. That has happened on too many occasions. I understand things happen but please take the time to reach out to the bloggers you are working with and let them know what is going on and who the new contact is.""

While Vetrano uses Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, she doesn't want to receive pitches through these channels, explaining ""I don’t get to check messages on a daily basis and might miss a pitch. The best way to pitch me is via e-mail.""

Regarding the products she's interested in for the gift guide, she says ""I cover a variety of topics on my site. I’m not necessarily a “niche” writer. I cover entertainment, house & home, food & beverages, toys & games, pet products, technology, health, beauty, fashion (plus size), jewelry and other topics.""","Provides family-friendly products and services reviews, book reviews, pet product reviews, food and beverage reviews and consumer electronics reviews.

Regarding communication preferences: ""I prefer to be pitched via email, but you can follow me on Twitter and Facebook to see if/when I mention your product in a post.""

She advises PR professionals that an effective pitch will, ""Start by using my name and be very specific with your request.""

Be specific with requests and don't beat around the bush."" She adds, ""I receive many emails each day, often from people who have never read my blog and have no idea how we cover topics.""

Do not follow up with her with comments such as ""Let us know when you post this."" Flannigan says, ""It is very unlikely that I will simply post about something you send me. I use all original photos on my blog, so unless I receive the product to style and photograph, I will not be posting about your client's product. 

Do not assume you are ""doing her a favor"" by pitching her. ""I am not looking for press. I have a solid site with a solid audience and you simply sharing about me is not an incentive to work with your product unless I love it.""

She also offers a Holiday Gift Guide, focused on luxury beauty products and accessories. Deadline for submissions is November 15.

She advises PR professionals to do their homework and personalize their pitch, and says, ""When sending a press release, make sure to take the time to personalize the pitch (e.g., the exact name of the editor/writer vs. ""Hey babe"" or ""Dear @beautyprofessor"" etc.) and be familiar with what type of publisher you are dealing with when it comes to press samples. For example, if a blog or website generates their own imagery (as is the case with Beauty Professor), offering high resolution images  (rather than the product itself) will probably not suffice when seeking earned media or sponsored features or even organic, last minute inclusions.""

Anise works 1-3 months out on content so receiving early access to product launches  is extremely helpful for encouraging inclusion. She adds, ""Sending out a press release for a launch that actually took place at major retailers weeks earlier will probably not elicit excited responses from editors as everyone in that particular industry already knows about it.""

One of her biggest pet peeves is when publicists do not respond to her inquiries. ""When a PR professional is not consistently responsive, especially if a project is in progress, it can impede content creation and even damage the relationship between the editor and the brand. I would much prefer a PR professional let me know that they got my note, have to investigate to find an answer and will get back to me soon rather than radio silence for an indeterminate amount of time.""

From sample sales to boutique openings, Refinery29 provides breaking fashion news along with local shopping reports, art and culture scoops, and drinking and dining tips from experts who know their cities best.

Posts vary in length and are always accompanied by images, video blogs, or hyperlinks to related articles. Main categories that feature on the blog include Fashion, Beauty, Living, Entertainment, How To and News. Within those categories the blog covers fashion news, beauty news, celebrities news, styling tips, what to wear, do it yourself, music, humour, art, celebrities, influencers, gadgets, travel, entertaining, food and drink, hair, nails, makeup, skin care, wellness, fitness, shopping, designers, street style, stores, trends, college, men's and events. The blog also covers news and topics that are focused on certain cities in the USA, those cities include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, D.C and Miami. The site is very active and on average it is updated around 10 times a day.

PR opportunities exist but are limited to news, reviews, interviews, and events. PRs are therefore recommended to familiarise themselves with the blog's content before establishing contact.

She is the Blogger for Shopping is My Cardio, covering Fashion, Holiday Gift Guide, Travel, Shopping, Fitness & Exercise and Beauty & Grooming. Cooper also is a Contributing Writer to Food & Travel Magazine, LuxeGetaways Magazine, Luxury Travel Magazine, and Upscale Living Magazine. She was noted as one of Cision's Top Travel Influencers of 2018.

For the holiday gift guide, she asks to send pitches to her email, but send products to her main address. 

Linda is interested in being pitched for being featured on her television show, as well as sponsorship opportunities and partnerships with lifestyle and travel brands for her television show and blog. She says, ""Please pitch me via email and I will get back to you within 24 hours.""

What will catch Cooper's eye are pitches that contain all pertinent information. She notes, ""I often receive pitches with no pictures or links attached in the body of the email which I find amusing as the pitch should be as user-friendly as possible.""

As far as what to pitch, Cooper elaborates, ""I love to feature new properties that have just opened to showcase on my TV show. Please share what makes the resort unique and different....maybe it has an eco-friendly aspect, perhaps a farm-to-table restaurant or a celebrity chef, a fabulous spa....etc.""

Cooper's advice to PR professionals is, ""It's always nice when someone watches my show and is familiar with what I feature prior to pitching me."" You can find seasons one of Travel Time with Linda on Amazon Prime Video and season two on AXS TV. If you get a feel for the show before you pitch her, it will definitely peak her interest in working with you - as opposed to cold calling her or including her in mass emails.

Regarding social media, she says, ""I do not like to receive pitches on my social media however it is my biggest resource on researching leads on what to feature for the show. As a PR pro, I would highly recommend you have your client update their website on a regular basis to keep it current and I often look for company blogs to see relevant news.""

Cooper adds one additional note, ""I am very approachable and look forward to hearing from you!""

facebook,60,Ms.,Kimberly,Vetrano,Blogger,She Scribes,https://www.facebook.com/SheScribes,https://www.linkedin.com/in/SheScribes,,,https://www.pinterest.com/shescribes,https://twitter.com/she_scribes,,kimberly@shescribes.com,http://www.shescribes.com,"Vetrano is a Blogger for She Scribes covering Entertainment, Family & Parenting, Pets & Pet Products, Technology, Toys, Beauty & Grooming, Personal Health & Wellness, Home, Lifestyle, Food & Beverages, Fashion, Jewelry, Games, and oversees New Product Reviews and the Holiday Gift Guides. The deadline for the Christmas gift guide is the end of November. The deadline for the other gift guides (Mather's Day, Father's Day, Back to School, etc.) is no less than three weeks before the holiday. 

Vetrano is flexible with pitches she accepts, acknowledging that it depends on the product or pitch. However, the best way to catch her attention it to gear the pitch toward her site, and/or her reader demographics.

""A pitch about a new vacuum is going to catch my attention more so than a pitch about a diaper bag or car seat since I don’t have infants and I don’t write about baby/toddler things,"" she says. 

""Take the time to check out my site, see what I write about and learn more about me so that you can pitch me with something that is clearly geared towards me and my blog. Also, please personalize the pitch. Don’t address it 'Dear Blogger' or even worse, 'Insert Name Here' (I have had MANY pitches like that).""

She continues, ""Someone with a cheery, upbeat attitude is going to impress me more than someone who sends me a form letter. I also like when PR reads a post or two on my site and mentions that in the pitch – for example ‘I think it’s cool that you have five cats and a dog. You must really love animals?.’ That tells me that the PR rep took the time to read my blog and sent me a pitch geared towards me and my blog and not just a blanket pitch.""

Vetrano advises PR professionals to learn about her before sending a pitch, and to be considerate of her personal life.

""If you take the time to read the ‘About Me’ section on a blog you will know it’s a waste of time to pitch baby products or garden products to me. Also, understand that blogging for most people takes a backseat to family life. You have to be a bit flexible and understanding. If you need a post up by a specific date you need to make that known at the very beginning so the blogger can plan accordingly. Also, please reply to e-mails in a prompt manner, especially when it has to do with a post. It’s hard to complete a post on time when the blogger has questions or needs more information and the PR person doesn't get back to them in a timely manner.""

On pet peeves, Vetrano comments, ""PR wanting me to post about a new product (without a review), a contest on a company’s website or a new campaign a company is working on. My time and my readers’ time is valuable. I am not going to post about every pitch that is sent to me unless it’s worth my time and effort, or unless it’s compensated in some way. I will post things for free but not all the time. I also do not write reviews based on photos! That is a huge pet peeve of mine. How am I expected to give a fair and honest review for my readers based on a products PHOTO?""

""Also, I can’t stand it when I am working on something and the PR rep leaves their job and doesn't let the blogger know who the new contact will be. That has happened on too many occasions. I understand things happen but please take the time to reach out to the bloggers you are working with and let them know what is going on and who the new contact is.""

While Vetrano uses Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, she doesn't want to receive pitches through these channels, explaining ""I don’t get to check messages on a daily basis and might miss a pitch. The best way to pitch me is via e-mail.""

Regarding the products she's interested in for the gift guide, she says ""I cover a variety of topics on my site. I’m not necessarily a “niche” writer. I cover entertainment, house & home, food & beverages, toys & games, pet products, technology, health, beauty, fashion (plus size), jewelry and other topics.""","Provides family-friendly products and services reviews, book reviews, pet product reviews, food and beverage reviews and consumer electronics reviews.

She prefers to receive pitches via email, and wants the subject line of the email to describe what the pitch is about. Her preferred lead time is at least four weeks, but is ""flexible if something is relevant and time sensitive."" 

If reaching her via social media, follow her on Twitter at @advicesisters and send a DM. Do not reach her via Facebook except via private message.

Additionally, pitches should not include numerous attachments. She says, ""Send a photo to illustrate, but not a dozen. If I want more information and I'm interested in the product, event or service I will ask for more.""

Further, she notes, ""If I don't know you and I get [a pitch] that is too vague I'm likely to delete it without opening it but if the pitch tells me specifically what it's about, I will at least take a look. Put your name, affiliation, phone number and email (in other words, contact information) in the email. I may know you as ""Janey"" but I might know several Janeys. How will I know which one you are without the identifiers. Also if you are inviting me to an event, Please don't just tell me it's at ""the Ritz"" (there could be more than one).

She prefers to receive pitches via email, and wants the subject line of the email to describe what the pitch is about. Her preferred lead time is at least four weeks, but is ""flexible if something is relevant and time sensitive."" 

If reaching her via social media, follow her on Twitter at @advicesisters and send a DM. Do not reach her via Facebook except via private message.

Additionally, pitches should not include numerous attachments. She says, ""Send a photo to illustrate, but not a dozen. If I want more information and I'm interested in the product, event or service I will ask for more.""

Further, she notes, ""If I don't know you and I get [a pitch] that is too vague I'm likely to delete it without opening it but if the pitch tells me specifically what it's about, I will at least take a look. Put your name, affiliation, phone number and email (in other words, contact information) in the email. I may know you as ""Janey"" but I might know several Janeys. How will I know which one you are without the identifiers. Also if you are inviting me to an event, Please don't just tell me it's at ""the Ritz"" (there could be more than one). And; I really love it when you tell me not just the address but the cross streets, or if the address is on an avenue but the building entrance is on a side street.""

Regarding the gift guide, she says, ""We cover everything for adult women, and some for men. No children or babies. Most interested in unique items that the recipients might not feel justified in buying for themselves including tech, luxury, fragrance, novelties,housewares.""

For Leather and Lace Advice she advises, ""pitch us first. If it is relevant and seems like something we want to cover, we will connect. We don't use a lot of ""experts"" and prefer to work with tangibles. We will attend events in the NYC area given some lead time. Note that our emphasis is on relationships, not pornography so even though we will work with adult topics, if they are not tasteful enough for general consumption we won't accept them.""","Leather and Lace Advice is a source for relationship and dating advice.

Stone says, ""The best rule of thumb to contact any blogger (not just me) is to do your homework.  Of course they’ll always be the mass pitch where you just need to get the information out there but if you want to work with a specific blogger on a specific project, you should actually READ their blog.  Before you pitch, make sure the product/topic actually makes sense- I get pitches constantly for plus sized clothing and baby products.  Seriously.  However, even if something isn’t a good fit, if I get a nice email from a publicist and I can tell that she/he has actually put a little effort in, I always respond.""

Partnership opportunities that benefit her blog and brands that recognize the time she invests as a blogger are sure to catch her attention.

Overstreet offers the following advice for PR professionals: ""My first piece of advice is to find out a blogger's first name and address them by it in your email. My second piece of advice is to make the email personalized to that blogger, so it doesn't feel like the statements about my style or blog are the same comments going out to 100 other bloggers. And finally, be sure to explain what your brand/company is! I often get emails from a company asking to work together, but at the end of the email I still don't have a good understanding of what they do, and I'm unlikely to seriously consider a partnership without a good understanding."" She also cites the following pet peeve: ""I think I can speak for many bloggers in saying that many pitch emails are not personalized whatsoever. Emails that begin with ""Dear Blogger,"" etc. are already at a disadvantage because it gives off the appearance that the company didn't take the time to find my name or what my blog is. Another pet peeve is when companies basically send crowd-sourcing emails out to bloggers, expecting them to produce free content for a brand without any compensation.""

She also says, 'I do look to social media to see what's trending, but emailing is still much preferred over anything else.

Hou welcomes beauty and wellness targeted pitches and press material, and prefers initial contact be made via email.“If it's something really quick, I don't mind a phone call, but I prefer that it's a follow up to an email. Sometimes messages can be hard to hear, especially if it's someone I don't know, so it's easier for me to have an idea of the brand and who's calling,” she said. Hou notes that big attachments or large emails should be avoided, with large lookbooks sent via mail.

With regard to content, Hou welcomes new ideas as well as more concrete information. “We're always looking for new and upcoming brands, especially niche brands, that's something we love to discover and that has always done well for us. Anything related to wellness, as we continue to build that, and also science, we love to hear about any scientific or technological advancements, as well as any kind of studies relating to health, nutrition, wellness or beauty,” she said.

Hou also points out the multi-faceted approach The Cut takes with beauty coverage, and noted that seemingly unrelated topics might make for good content. “Even things that people don't necessarily think traditionally relate to beauty, like, I got a study once about selfies. It's not necessarily a direct beauty link, but we see it as body image or self-esteem,” she said.
