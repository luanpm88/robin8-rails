            <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h3>
            <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
            <p>MyPRGenie will not collect any personally identifiable information about you - such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address - unless you provide it to us voluntarily and approve its use.</p>
            <p>At various locations on our Site, such as in registration forms, online stores, message boards, blogs and surveys, we may request that you supply us with personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address, mailing and shipping addresses, home or work telephone number, birth date, gender and/or credit card information). If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. When you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may use that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may also use that information to contact you, for example, to answer a question or respond to a comment you have submitted. In addition, we may use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product and event announcements, news, special offers, to notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes and for communicating other information we think you would like to hear about. In order to submit yourself for a role listed on our Site, you must create a profile. Your profile consists of your credits and special skills. Only those that you have invited to view your profile, other than the Site administrators, will be able to view your profile - no other Site visitors will have access to your profile.</p>
            <p>When available, your privacy options will be set by you as the user according to the privacy settings under your account. Any adjustments to the privacy policy will be based on the settings that you make. For the avoidance of doubt, although your complete profile will not be available to the public, the foregoing shall not be construed as a limitation of MyPRGenie's right to use or exploit one or more elements from your profile on the Site in accordance with the Agreement. However, we will not provide your information to third parties without your consent, except as required by law as explained in the "Information Sharing" and "Certain Third Party Transactions" sections below.</p>
            <p>If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future notices.</p>
            <p>MyPRGenie does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information. If you are under the age of 13, you should not furnish us with any identifiable information about yourself without the written verifiable consent of your parent or guardian. If MyPRGenie learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on the Site without verified parental consent, then MyPRGenie will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
            <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
            <p>In some cases, when you visit our Site, we may also collect information that is non-personally identifiable information or information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you use, demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.), the date and time you visited our Site, the pages you accessed, the name of the website from which you linked to our Site and other anonymous data involving your use of our Site. We use this information to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h3>ONLINE STORE</h3>
            <p>We may use the information that you provide to communicate with you about products purchased through our online store, to provide customer support in connection with those products, and to send you information about products and services which we believe may be of interest to you. We do not share your financial information with any third party without your consent, except to a court or governmental agency if permitted by law, as authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction or to the limited extent described below under "Certain Third Party Transactions". If you make a purchase through our online store, we may use the information you provide to send you important announcements and updates regarding our Site, online products, services, events and any other information that we think may be of interest to you. You may also receive periodic mailings regarding new products and services. However, you may opt-out from receiving future mailings by contacting us at info@myprgenie.com</p>
            <h3>COOKIES</h3>
            <p>MyPRGenie may use "cookies" - pieces of data stored on your computer tied to information about you. This information will be in the form of a cookie or similar file and will help us enhance your web experience by saving time on the Site. Cookies do not contain or store any personal information but may be tied to the personal information you knowingly choose to provide to us. Cookies can store non-personally identifiable information, such as what websites, pages, or advertisements your browser has accessed.</p>
            <p>MyPRGenie uses both persistent and session cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. When the session ends, the browser is closed and the cookies go away. We use session cookies to maintain certain information that we need so that you may, for example, shop on our Site. In this case, your browser retains the session ID cookie for your shopping bag. Without this session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit. Persistent cookies are saved on a visitor's computer by the browser and do not go away when you exist your browser. This allows us to give you a more personalized experience and helps you navigate our Site more efficiently. However, you can use our Site without accepting persistent cookies. MyPRGenie uses both types of cookies to enable us to collect aggregate information on the usage patterns of our Site, such as what areas of the Site are visited most often, so we can tailor our site to user preferences. This means that when you log into the Site using your user name and password, information about what you visit on the Site, while you are logged in, will be linked to the personal information that you provide to us. If you choose to visit the site without logging in, then information about what you visit on the Site is only collected on an anonymous, aggregate basis, and is not tied to your personal information.</p>
            <p>You have control over cookies. Most Internet browsers can be set to refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience. You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these functions</p>
            <h3>E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
            <p>If you send us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use the personal information you provide to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. There may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list or electronic newsletter that will send information about our Site. However, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications. You may request at any time that we not e-mail you in the future by clicking the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any e-mail that you receive from us and hitting send, or by contracting us at info@myprgenie.com. When contacting us by email, please insert "PRIVACY" in the subject line and one of the following in the body of the message: (1) Please do not send me email, (2) Keep my email address private, or (3) Don't send email/Keep my email address private. If you unsubscribe, you should assume that your request has been received and is being processed. Please allow ten (10) business days from when the request was received to complete the removal of your email address from our database as some of our promotions may have been in process before submitting such request we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these e-mail communications as soon as practicable. In addition, you may contact us at info@myprgenie.com to request that we not disclose your personal information to unrelated third parties for marketing purposes. Please include your name, address and state "NO THIRD PARTY SHARING" in your request.</p>
            <h3>CERTAIN THIRD PARTY TRANSACTIONS</h3>
            <p>MyPRGenie may disclose personal information to third parties we engage to assist us in providing you certain services. For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us deliver our products or services to you. We may also use a third party to process online transactions and credit card payments, provide products, advertising, marketing or promotional services/assistance, provide e-mail services, or facilitate our online services. In these instances, we may need to share your personal information. We require these companies to use your personal information only to provide that particular product or service and do not authorize them to use your personal information for any other reason. In addition, if some or all of the assets of MyPRGenie are sold to a third party, such third party will be entitled to use the information disclosed by users of our Site. Both the personal and non-personal information that we or other third parties have collected will likely be transferred as part of the transaction. If we sell our business, we will attempt to ensure that requests made of us regarding e-mail communications will be honored.</p>
            <h3>INFORMATION SHARING</h3>
            <p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose information as required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to protect its rights and/or to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. MyPRGenie reserves the right to use or disclose non-personal information in any way we see fit.</p>
            <h3>SECURITY</h3>
            <p>Our Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. MyPRGenie safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and other procedures. However, as it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information you disclose online, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and use a secure browser.</p>
            <p>All personal data you submit to us through the Site is encrypted with secure server software (SSL) that encodes the information before your Web browser software sends it to us. The SSL software decodes the data only after it reaches MyPRGenie's server, meaning that your data will be encrypted were hackers to intercept it while in transit. Once the data reaches our server, your private account and customer information is located on a secure service behind a firewall. It is not directly connected to the Internet.</p>
            <h3>LINKS TO NON-MYPRGENIE SITES</h3>
            <p>Our Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that MyPRGenie is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site.</p>

            <h3>VISITOR CONDUCT/DISPUTES</h3>
            <p>Statements, messages, text, files, images, photos, videos, or other materials ("Materials") posted by visitors to the Site, whether on profiles, message boards, blogs or in other formats, are the sole responsibility of the visitor who posted such Materials and reflect the opinions of the visitor who has posted them and not of MyPRGenie. Although we discourage the use of any Site functionality, including profiles, message boards and blogs, for anything other than lawful and constructive discourse, we cannot effectively monitor all Materials posted by visitors on our Site and, therefore, make no representation and warranty with respect to the veracity, reliability or completeness of any such Materials. Accordingly, your reliance on any such Materials shall be at your own risk</p>
            <p>Without limiting anything set out above, MyPRGenie assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Site for inappropriate Materials or conduct. If, at any time, we choose, in our sole discretion, to monitor the Site, we nonetheless assume no responsibility for the Materials, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Materials and no responsibility for the conduct of the visitor submitting any such Materials; however, MyPRGenie does reserve the right to remove any Materials that it determines, in its sole discretion, violates this Agreement or is otherwise unacceptable or inappropriate. The visitor shall remain responsible for any and all Materials he or she posts.</p>
            <p>As a general rule, as set out in our Site's Privacy Policy, no personally identifiable information is automatically collected from users of our Site. If MyPRGenie does decide to change its policies, it will post such changes in accordance with this Agreement and/or its Privacy Policy. Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example, on your personal profile, message boards, through e-mail, or in blogs - that information can be collected and used by others, as set forth in the privacy policy. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to other members, we cannot control the other members' use of that information.
