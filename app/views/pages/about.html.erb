            <p>Miranda Tan, Founder and CEO of MyPRGenie, founded her first PR firm, ExcitePR, in 1999. She realized that startups offering amazing products were constantly running into the same problem: how could they reach out to the media and their customers on a limited budget with only expensive PR services available? Miranda’s goal was to build a PR platform and content marketing solution for companies and to get top tier placements that was effective and affordable.</p>
            <p>Miranda’s answer was MyPRGenie, an intuitive, easy to use, do-it-yourself PR software platform that she founded in 2007 with her partner, digital media pro Hassan Miah. By 2010, the PR solution had been named a Top 100 OnDemand Software Company, a Top 100 Mid-Atlantic Private Company, and a Top 100 OnMedia company by AlwaysOn.</p>
            <p>In 2014, with the emergence of big data and machine learning as pillars of the latest technological advancements, Miranda and Hassan, in partnership with some of the world’s brightest technology thought leaders, rebuilt MyPRGenie’s PR platform to take advantage of next generation online Artificial Intelligence technology. After months of hard work and collaboration, Robin8 was created.</p>
