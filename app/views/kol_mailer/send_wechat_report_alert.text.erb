Hi, <%= @first_name %> <%= @last_name %>!

It is time to submit report of your WeChat performance for '<%= @campaign_name %>'.
Please go to your dashboard and proceed with it.

Important note 1: it is required to upload screenshot of your WeChat page with related post. Date on the uploaded screenshot shall correspond to the report submission date; otherwise your data will not be approved by Robin8 admin.

Important note 2: you have to submit your report on each 7th day after approval of your article, since WeChat only stores data during 7 days after the article posted. If you will delay submission of the report, your performance data (number of people reached, number of page views, number of "read more", number of re-share + favorites) for the delayed days will not be count.
